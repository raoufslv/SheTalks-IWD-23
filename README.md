# Challege : Act of grace 
 ‘Act of grace’ is a challenge  to use technology and innovation to make a positive impact in the world. Science and technology have the potential to change people's lives for the better by addressing social issues, improving access to services and resources, and promoting
equity. 

And we chose to impact the category that is the most affected by danger and conflicted to violence , in our society or I say all the world, Women.

   
Shetalks is a 100% dedicated platform for women, to help those in need and bring them together in a safe and secure place, and let them talk and express their emotions or problems  pursuing the concept of mental healthcare.

# Concept of SHeTalks

  Our platform opens its doors for all women who have suffered or are suffering any type of abuse, depression, any problem she wants to talk about and she cannot find where to take refuge or she feels ashamed, we give them the opportunity to empty their hearts and tell their stories or experience by posting them in either anonymous or public posts, or they'll be greeted by a commuter who's been through the same things as them, so voicing their stories won't only help them, but those who around by making them know they are not alone and she's not alone. We added some quiz to gather some data  using data analytics to know what is in their interests and what is not.

But our 'act of grace' doesn't stop there, we even thought of offering them free therapies.

 **Explenation**
 
 Quite a few students in psychology are looking for internships but do not find any . Here we are, we suggest that they come to our platform as counselors to help certain women. 
  
**Process** 
   the counselor scrolls and finds a case that interests or touches him, he sends her a message (if the publication was anonymous, the identity of the person does not appear until the other responds ), we give the counselor the privilege of contacting the person and not the opposite, to avoid overloading the counselors, once the message accepted some sessions will take place. These same advisors (or therapists) can publish educational and awareness articles, and even organize visual meetings...


 It's an act of grace but doesn't mean we are not going to win some income, we are going to make a premium version for people who want to have therapists at their service which will be in a paid mode.
